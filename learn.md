**Here I'll keep mentioning How did I learn through this entire Project**

WE'll Start by building the backend first, test it then we'll go with the React

We'll build our own apis using fastapi and expose them like /generatestory, /getstory, /getstoryresults etc 

we'll be using uvicorn to create virtual environment and install dependencies
